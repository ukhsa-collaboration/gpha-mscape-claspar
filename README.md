# 👻 ClasPar 👻 - the friendly classifier parser 
This repository houses the code for ClasPar: the friendly classifier parser that parses, filters and writes classifier results to analysis tables. 

Specifically, this is a Python-based module with a commandline interface, `claspar` package and set up in such a way as to be run in the Orange-Box within a NextFlow workflow. 

## What does it do?
It parses, filters and writes results and analysis tables for classifiers. Specifically, it handles Kraken (bacteria), Sylph (bacteria/archaea) and viral_aligner (viruses) outputs. 

It applies filters using the config file in `src/claspar/data/filter_thresholds.yaml` by default (or a custom config file can be defined). 

It uses the OnyxAnalysisHelper to write all the results to json files, was well as all the results to csv files. 

## 🔧 Installation for Command Line Use 🔧
1) Set up environment - It is recommended that you install claspar into a suitable environment. For example:

Create a new environment
```
conda env create -n claspar  
conda activate claspar  
```

2a.) Either clone the repo and install from there:
```
git clone git@github.com:ukhsa-collaboration/gpha-mscape-claspar.git
cd gpha-mscape-claspar
pip install .
```

__or:__

2b.) Install directly into the environment using pip:

```
pip install https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/gpha-mscape-claspar.git
```


### 🔨 Installation for developers (installs code in editable mode) 🔨:  
```
git clone git@github.com:ukhsa-collaboration/gpha-mscape-claspar.git
cd gpha-mscape-claspar
pip install --editable '.[dev]'
```

## 🖱️ Usage 🖱️

On the commandline, once installed, run:

```
claspar --sample_id <ID> --output_dir <DIR> --server mscape
```
Where `ID` is a valid sample ID and `DIR` is a valid output directory. This method includes an Onyx call, and therefore 
requires all the necessary credentials and connectivity. 

However, it is possible to run ClasPar with a samplesheet (in 2x2 format, tab-seperated, with the columns 'climb-id' and 
'full_Onyx_json'):

```
claspar --sample_id <ID> --output_dir <DIR> --server mscape --samplesheet <TSV FILE>
```
***NOTE**: sample ID is still required.*

## 📃 Inputs: 📃
| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| --sample_id, -s | Yes | Climb-ID for sample |
| --output_dir, -o | Yes |  Path to directory where results will be saved to. The directory is made if it doesn't exist already. |
| --config, -c | No |  Path to yaml file with filtering thresholds. Default can be seen in src/claspar/data/filter_thresholds.yaml |
| --server, -s | Yes  | Must be one of: [mscape, synthscape]. Specify server code is being run on - helpful if developing on synthscape and running on mscape |
| --samplesheet, -t | No | Path to samplesheet. Must be tsv, should have header 'full_Onyx_json' or 2 columns, 1 row. |
| --log-file, -l | No | Path to log file. Default will be a file called '/sample-id/_claspar_/date-time/.log' in the output directory (where sample_id is the climb-id for the sample and /date-time/ is the date and time of running). |

## 📤 Outputs: 📤

There are a few outputs for a single sample, plus a log file. The log file appears in the same location as the outputs. 

- `<sample_id>_<data-time>_claspar.log` - This is the log file and will contain helpful information and progress. 
- `<sample_id>_filtered_viral_aligner_results.csv` - These are the viral aligner results filtered to those that pass the thresholds in the supplied config. 
- `<sample_id>_<classifier>_analysis_fields.json` - This is the analysis table in json format, containing all the required analysis information. There is one per classifier. 
- `<sample_id>_kraken_processed_genera.csv` - This is a table of all of the taxa at a genus level Kraken called. It has some additional columns with info about the species within the genus.
- `<sample_id>__kraken_processed_species.csv` - This is a table of all of the taxa at a species level Kraken called. It has some additional columns with info about the parent taxa (at genus level), total species in genus identified (and species that pass the filters), the proportion of total genus reads, the rank of that in its genus and the kraken confidence (high if it passes all of the filters, else low).
- `<sample_id>_sylph_processed.csv` - The sylph results after applying filtering and confidence (high if is passes all of the filters, else low). 


## 🔨 Troubleshooting: 🔨

- `claspar -h` returns list of help information for commands.
- The log should contain adequate information if there is an error or warning.
- There are unit tests available with test data. Run `pytest .` in the root of the repo after cloning. (You might need to have installed using 'Developer' settings.).
- The commandline entry point is in the `main()` function in main.py. There is a class per parser, split between bacteria.py and virus.py. 
- package entry points are through `claspar.main.main`, which in turn calls `claspar.setup` (which houses some set up functionality like config parsing), `claspar.bacteria` (which houses the `KrakenBacteria` and `SylphBacteria` classes) and `claspar.virus` (which houses the 'VirusClasPar' class)
